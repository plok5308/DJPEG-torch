## Training
Training process from scratch weights. It needs the dataset.
```bash
$ python train.py
```

## Valid
Valid script. It needs the dataset and the network weights. ACC, TPR, TNR are 93.28%, 90.59%, 95.97% respectively.
```bash
$ python valid.py
```

## Application
Detecting splicing and copy-move forgery example. It needs the network weights.
```bash
$ python application.py
```
